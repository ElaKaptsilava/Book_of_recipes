<b>Cookbook</b>. This project is a collection of Python recipes for various tasks and challenges. It is inspired by the Python Cookbook books by Oâ€™Reilly Media, which provide practical solutions and examples for Python programmers. The recipes in this project are written and tested with Python 3.9, but they should work with other versions of Python 3 as well. Each recipe contains a problem statement, a solution, and a discussion of how and why the solution works. The code samples are formatted using code blocks. This project is intended for experienced Python programmers who want to learn new techniques and idioms, or refresh their knowledge of Python. It is also a useful resource for beginners who want to see how Python can be used to solve various problems. The project is open to contributions from the Python community, and welcomes feedback and suggestions.
